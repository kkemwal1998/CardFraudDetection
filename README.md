Project Name: Credit Card Fraud Prediction Model

Kaggle Data Set Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Algorithms Applied: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Class:

a) 0 represents no fraud

b) 1 represents fraud.

Project Introduction: My project involves the development of a predictive model and  interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI, centered around the Kaggle dataset "Credit Card Fraud Detection".  

Project Objective: Prediction of credit card frauds

Process:-

The development cycle model follows 5 steps:

1) Database Acquisition:
     After the data was extracted from Kaggle in a CSV format, it was uploaded to Jupyter Notebook     
     using the Pandas library. Followed by the importation of numpy, seaborn, and matplot libraries.

2) Database Dashboard: 
     Development of an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to further dive into the data 
     related to the fraud classes. 
       Graph 1: The pie chart illustrates the fraud class distribution of the average amount of money among the transactions.
       Graph 2: The pie chart illustrates the fraud class distribution of the average amount of time among the transactions.

3) EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
     It focuses on analyzing the correlation between the fraud class and other essential variables.

4) Training and testing: 
     70% of the dataset has been assigned to training procedures under SVM model and  30% of the   
     the database has been assigned to testing procedures 

5) Model Evaluation: 
     Preparation of classification report to analyze the number of true cases of the 
     model.

6) Model Deployment: Full-scale deployment of model for business applications
